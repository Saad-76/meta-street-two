        <p>
          Successful entrepreneurs, celebrities, marketing veterans and
          world-renowned digital artists are now working together to help answer
          that question.
        </p>
        <p>At the end of December 2021, all fates will be decided.</p>
        <p>
          As that’s the date the Prime Ape Planet sends out its first ever VIP
          invitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you’d be wise to snatch one for yourself and everyone you care
          about. Because once this collection of 7979 unique NFTs mint?
        </p>

        <p>But early supporters of the project will be handsomely rewarded.</p>
        <p>
          As masters of digital art, the art team behind Prime Ape Planet has
          enjoyed success in the “Old World.” Their work has always gained
          mainstream recognition and adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ve worked on titles such as The Lion King, Godzilla, and
          countless other animations… For industry household names including
          Marvel, Disney, and MGM among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prime Ape Planet will be the project to plant their flags in the
          Metaverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like our offline culture, the NFT space won’t ever be the same
          after their contribution.
        </p>
        <p>Join them before it’s too late on Discord:</p>
