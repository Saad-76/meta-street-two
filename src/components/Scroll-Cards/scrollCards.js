                    Make sure you join our Discord server to find out how to get
                    whitelisted. The mechanism to get whitelisted will get
                    difficult as the project will progress and closer to mint.

                    Everything starts and ends with the community. The moment we
                    prioritize something other than the community will be the
                    beginning of the end. We won't let that happen, because

                    <b>Meta Street Apes</b> are creative, brave, and relentless.
                    It's easy to follow trends and improve incrementally. It's
                    harder to be original and do dope sh*t. We pave our own

                    Good things take time. Decentralized movements can't turn
                    corners as quickly as centralized movements, and that's both
                    a blessing and a curse. Decentralized doesn't mean there
                    can't be leaders. The core team will provide guard rails and

                    It also means we need to figure out governance for the brand

                    Many will try to create one, but few teams have the

                    with mass market appeal and scalability. Sandbox VR,
                    Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, and Somnium Space are a few
                    platforms we are considering. Though the core team has the
